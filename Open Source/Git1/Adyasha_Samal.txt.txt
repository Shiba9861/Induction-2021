I was introduced to programming when I was in +2 science,since I had opted for computer as one of my subjects 
then.There,we had learnt some basics of C++ program.I have also covered html and css part required for front end 
web dev,yet need to chisel the skills more,so as to get better at it!! Then,LOC has helped us to gather C program
knowledge, thanks to our seniors. And at the present,trying to get hold of the git commands,as a part of our 1st 
task.Excited to learn CP in the upcoming weeks!!!!!!
