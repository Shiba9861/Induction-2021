# Task2

## Problem Statement:



#### Your task is :

- Update your local repo's main branch  

- Add an image of something with the following specifications:

  > **Image File Name**: The image file name must be **your name** only.

    _for example_ [Ashutosh-Khanduala.jfif](./Ashutosh-khanduala.jfif)

    **Image File Location**: `./Open Source/Git2/ `

    **Content in that Image**:- Can be anything nice(e.g. your face, or a dish, or a pet, etc).


Now commit your changes and push your file to your forked repo and create a PR. Mentors will automatically come to know if you have updated your outdated repo or not.


----------------------------------
## ⚠⚠⚠IMPORTANT⚠⚠⚠

- Put that new file in `/Open Source/Git2/`  folder only

**If your PR doesn’t follow the above instruction strictly then your PR will be Rejected!**
